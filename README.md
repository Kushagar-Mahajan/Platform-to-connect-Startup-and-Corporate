The platform shall fulfill following two key objectives: A. Corporates shall be able to list challenges and source ideas from innovators. B.

We have a generic application where both startups and corporates can register, make profiles and start using the application functionality which includes listing challenges, publishing ideas, ranking fellow startups and corporates. All the data generated is processed and used to connect startups and corporates in an efficient way.

Solution:-
A Web Application to connect the Startup and Corporates.
Secure Platform for database storage and content delivery with Authentication.
Supports multiple users simultaneously.
Community oriented and pure connection.
It is helpful for startups to get connected with the cooperate and secure funding and incubation.
Features:-
In this we have included a startup ranking system in which each startup could be ranked.
We have included a tag system in which the tags would be added to startup such that the most searched tag would get the higher ranking in the list.
There will be API’s for regulatory bodies (MSME, NIC etc) to fetch data on startups and corporates
User Friendly Environment.
